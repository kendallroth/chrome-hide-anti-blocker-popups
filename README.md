# Hide Anti-Blocker Popups

> Chrome extension to hide anti-blocker popups (automatic and manual).

> **NOTE:** Currently only supports `tp-modal` popups (requires more research)!

## Development

Go to Chrome extensions and unpack the project.

## ToDo

- Store "hiding" result for popup (currently only displays once)
- Support additional types of popups (requires more research)
